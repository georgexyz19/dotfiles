After git clone the repo, run $python3 newlinks.py to create new hard links in home dir.

Made a big change to the repo.  Change the original .simple to .vimrc, and
change original .vimrc to .python.  The .python setting has lots of plugins
enabled.  It seems that some plugins do not work correct.  I do not know which
one works well and which one does not.
